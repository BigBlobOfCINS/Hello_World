Introducing Chainsurance

I'm over 40 but I'm still pretty healthy.  Last year I made some money trading crypto.  I did not tell anyone and I dont want to go ballin around being ridiclous like some people do when they finally make some money after being poor for a long time.  What I really want is to feel young again.  So I went over to the skete shop and bought a custom deck.  As I was puttering around the park like a pathetic old man tryin to ride goofy foot for the first time in my life (For some reason I always lined up left foot forward when I was a kid.) My knee popped out and I ate shit.  I got back on my popsicle stick, painfully pushed my old ass back to my car, drove home and looked up insurance for skateboarders.  Here is the article I read: http://www.jenkemmag.com/home/2017/06/23/affordable-care-acts-effect-skateboard-industry/
Well someone should make that shit if It does not exist!  So then I read this article: http://smallbusiness.chron.com/start-independent-insurance-company-2306.html 
Maybe I'll never be a great skateboarder but I could be a hero to the shateboarding community If I can pave over this little pothole in reality with some blockchain blacktop.
I read a toutorial about how to make my own erc20 token in under 20 minuits.  It took me three days, but I got that example code to compile.
Ugh my programming skills are roughly equal to my skateboarding skills.  Maybe in another week or two I'll actually get it deployed.
Once it's deployed and I start distributing I need make a new token that actually has some features so I can swap to the new contract before I run out of the first version.  Thats the plan at the moment anyway...
Btw my knee recovered pretty quick and I have been back to the park a few times already.
